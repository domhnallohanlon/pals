                Partner, Qualified 1974 <br>
                Ronnie has practised in Dun Laoghaire all his working life.
                He set up in 1981 under the title RJ Lynam &amp; Co Solicitors before amalgamating with Partners at Law in 1993.
                Ronnie commands one of the most substantial criminal law practices in the Republic of Ireland.
                He has held a post as academic lecturer in the LSI School of Law.
                He handles all matters arising in the Dun Laoghaire District Court and has led some of Ireland’s leading criminal law cases including:- “C” -v- Ireland &amp; ors. This case went to the Supreme Court and successfully challenged the constitutionality of sect 1(1) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935
                – “A” -v- Ireland &amp;ors. This case followed immediately after the “C” case. The High Court here held that the conviction and sentence of A could not be upheld because of the decision of the “C” case. The Supreme Court controversially reversed this decision. Both these cases were the cause of legislation and almost brought about the downfall of a government.

                The Intoxilizer Cases. This was a series of cases taken together and brought before the Supreme Court. Ronnie was successful in challenging the inappropriate use of Garda powers of arrest, detention and questioning.
                Ronnie’s expertise has been recognised by national radio, television and the printed media for his comment on road traffic and criminal law from time to time.
                Ronnie’s areas of expertise include road traffic offences, crime, personal injury<sup>*</sup>, licensing applications and consumer law.

        Conveyancing involves the legal steps to buy or sell a property. When acting for the buyer, we will investigate thoroughly the property’s title (ownership), raising all necessary questions with the solicitor acting for the seller. If we are not satisfied with the answers to our questions, or with any other aspect of the sale, we may advise you not to buy the particular property.

        When acting for the seller, we prepare all of the documents needed by the buyer’s solicitor.

        In any property transaction, our job is to transfer the legal title from the seller to the buyer. Other matters may include planning issues or drawing or checking maps. You may be able to deal with these issues yourself or with the help of an architect or other professional.

        When you sign a contract for the sale or purchase of a property, we will give you a date for when the sale should be closed and the keys handed over. However, unavoidable delays often arise and the sale may not close on that date. We will be able to advise you of an exact completion date closer to the date stated in the contract so that you can make the final arrangements.

        If you are purchasing a property, you will need to supply funds to pay stamp duty, if it is required, and, in all cases, to pay Property Registration Authority (PRA) fees to register your property. You must pay these amounts before the sale is completed. If you are getting a loan from a bank or building society, they will not issue the loan cheque unless we give them our professional promise to stamp and register your deeds after the sale closes. We cannot promise this unless we already have the funds needed.

        If your conveyancing transaction is tax driven or where there are VAT implications you should ensure that you have obtained independent tax advice. We recommend you use your accountant for this purpose as the one most suited to understand your needs and intentions.

        If a conveyancing transaction is abandoned there will be a legal charge for work done to bring the matter to the point of conclusion. The amount of this charge will depend on how much time and effort was expended by those involved.

                </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
        Anyone who goes to court engages in litigation. In Ireland litigation takes many forms. Essentially it is an adversarial system of resolving issues of a legal nature. Every action taken culminates in a hearing before a judge but not every action ends up in court.

        Criminal litigation is instigated by the State through the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuting actions against individuals for alleged crimes committed.

        Civil litigation involves disputes between litigants (otherwise known as parties). The party can be a person or a corporate entity. The party taking the action is known as the plaintiff or the applicant and party opposing is referred to as the defendant or the respondent.

        The most common form of civil action is a claim for compensation due to Personal Injuries<sup>*</sup> caused as a result of the negligence on the part of a defendant. All claims of this nature are required by law to be notified to The Injuries Board. If an Injuries Board award is accepted costs cannot be awarded. In this case, any fees payable must be paid out of the award.

        If the Injuries Board award is not accepted legal proceedings may then be instituted. In that event, if successful, part of the costs are paid by the insurance company. These are known as party and party costs. Solicitor/Client costs may also be charged. All issues relating to fees, costs and other charges are explained, set out and agreed in advance of every transaction.

        At Partners at Law no fees are charged to the client if a claim is unsuccessful.

        <sup>*</sup> In contentious business, a solicitor may not calculate fees or other charges as a percentage or proportion of any award or settlement.

                </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
        A Will is a written witnessed document setting out the testator’s wishes as to how his or her possessions otherwise known as the estate is disposed of.

        If a person dies without making a will that person is said to have died intestate. The estate in this case will then be disposed of by an administrator in accordance with the law . The rules of intestacy are set out in the Succession Act. That act explains that where a deceased person has left a spouse and children without making a will, two thirds of the estate then passes to the spouse while the remaining one third passes to the children. If there are no children the spouse takes all. Where an unmarried person dies intestate then that estate goes to next of kin.

        For a will to be valid the person making the will must be over 18 and the will must be in writing. The testator, who is the person making the will, must be capable of doing so. In other words, the testator cannot be suffering from a mental incapacity or operating under the influence of another person. The testator must sign or mark the will in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign the will in the testator’s presence at the same time as the testator. The witnesses cannot receive any gifts under the will.

        The Succession Act confers benefits on spouses of deceased persons. In this situation a surviving spouse has a legal right to a share of the estate. If there are no children that legal share is a half of the estate. If there are children it is one third. This legal right can be renounced. There are strict rules of notification required under the Succession Act imposed on the executor of the will. The executor is a person named by the testator to be responsible for the administration of the estate.

        Children have no automatic entitlement to a share of a parents estate. They can however make an application in Court for a share on the basis that the testator has failed as a parent in his or her moral duty towards a disappointed child.

        A will can be changed at any time by making a new will amending an existing one or by creating a separate document called a codicil. An existing will is automatically revoked when a new will is made. Revocation is also automatic when a testator marries or remarries. In order to revoke a will otherwise the testator or someone in the presence of the testator must burn, tear or destroy the will with the intention of revoking it. In this case if a will is made without a new one having taken its place then that person is deemed to have died intestate.

        <div class="modal-body">
        If it happens that a person becomes unable to manage his/her assets because of a mental incapacity an application may be made by way of petition to the High Court to have this person made a ward of court. The judge will then make a decision as to whether the person is in fact capable of managing his or her own property and that decision is influenced by two medical reports that are presented. If the petition is successful a committee is appointed. The purpose of the committee is to control the ward’s property and make decisions on behalf of the ward. The Court must be satisfied that the person is of unsound mind and incapable of managing his or her own affairs.
        <br>
        When making the application to the High Court, information should be provided about the ward concerning his or her medical condition; next of kin; assets; and income. The application is made by way of affidavit and there is no need for the committee to be present when the application is being made. If, however, the ward objects then a further enquiry will be held before a jury. In order for a person to object that person must sign an objection notice and have the signatures witnessed by a solicitor.
        <br>
        The costs of a wardship are awarded by the court and usually come out of the assets of the person who is being made a ward of court.

                    <h4 class="modal-title"> Power of Attorney</h4>
                </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
        A power of attorney is a legal instrument created by a person called the donor. It can be a simple form signed when the donor is in good health. It allows another specifically appointed person called an attorney to take actions on behalf of the donor when the donor is absent abroad or incapacitated in some way, possibly through illness.
        <br>
        There are two types of power of attorney:
        <ul>
        <li>
        There is a general power of attorney that is given by the donor and ceases as soon as the donor becomes incapacitated or arrives home from abroad. A general power of attorney can be revoked and all actions taken by the attorney must be capable of being ratified by the donor.        
        </li>
        <li>
        An enduring power of attorney is created by person who is in good health but only comes into effect when the donor becomes incapable of managing his or her own affairs through mental illness. These powers can be extensive and may include personal care decisions to be made on the donor’s behalf. Personal care decisions include where and with whom the donor will live; who the donor may or may not see; and what rehabilitation the donor should get. All these powers can be specifically chosen by the donor when creating the power and may be made subject to conditions. Both forms of power of attorney cease on the donor’s death.    
        </li>
        </ul>
        Among the documents required for the purposes of an enduring power of attorney is a statement from a doctor confirming the donor’s mental capacity; a statement from the donor confirming that he or she understands the effects of creating the power; a statement from a solicitor confirming that he or she is happy that the donor understood the effect of creating the power; a statement from the solicitor that the donor is not acting under undue influence; two notices served on the next of kin; and signed acknowledgements from the attorneys after the power is created.
        <br>
        The process of registration then repeats the exercise to the extent that notices are served and a doctor’s certificate is obtained this time confirming the donor’s mental incapacity. The process of registration only occurs where it is necessary to give effect to the enduring power.
        <br>
        A power of attorney may be revoked at any time prior to registration. After registration the enduring power of attorney can only be revoked by application to the Court. This application can be made on the basis, for instance, that the attorney is unsuitable or that the donor was acting under undue pressure at the time of the creation of the power.
        <br>
        While the enduring power of attorney provided for personal care decisions the attorney is not authorised to make health care decisions on the donor’s behalf. This is a matter for the donor’s medical attendants.

                                The basic rights of senior members of our community are under threat every day from the most surprising source, their own family. This can manifest itself as financial abuse in the simplest of ways. For instance, a persuasive son or daughter may suggest that Credit Union savings be nominated in his or her favour. This is called “exercising undue influence”. It can be tackled with foresight and action. The most effective tool in the drawer is the enduring power of attorney. You will find this under “The law explained” on our home page. A will is another instrument giving power to the elderly. In each case the secret of the document is the appointment; and, putting the right person in charge in the event of certain circumstances arising.
                            Give Justin a call in total confidence.
